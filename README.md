# Full Page Recommender

This algorithm serves personalized pages with a list of collections and
their corresponding items instead of a single set of items. It highlights
the most relevant collections at the top and includes soft de-duplication to
showcase the entire catalog, encouraging users to explore beyond their usual
choices.

A collection is a group of scored items with a label for display.
Collections can be sorted to keep the item order fixed, which is useful for
static lists like _"Top 10 Books This Week."_

An item's score within a collection reflects its relevance to the user and
the collection. For example, [_"Zombieland"_][zombieland-wiki] may score
higher in the _"Comedy Movies"_ collection than in _"Post-Apocalyptic Movies"_
since post-apocalyptic viewers may not be interested in it.

Item scores can originate from a single recommendation algorithm, but this
is not mandatory. For instance, one might use a model based on item metadata
for collections with cold items, like _"Just Released,"_ while employing a
rating-based model for other collections. The FPR algorithm does not provide
a model, but I plan to add [EASE][ease-arxiv] in the future. Additionally, I
aim to implement a solution to automatically generate collections and their
labels using Node2Vec embedding and nested clustering.

## Key Features

### Item De-duplication

De-duplication uses item temperatures. When an item is recommended in a
collection, its temperature increases, reducing its score for future rows. 
This allows the item to appear in multiple rows but keeps them spaced out.

### Device-specific recommendations

Each device type typically shows different number of items without the need
of horizontal scrolling. For that reason we allow passing in score for each
tile position to optimize for each screen size.
